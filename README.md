# Culinary Keepsakes
Culinary Keepsakes is a project designed to store recipes I've come across over the years that I thought were worth saving.

## Features

- Store and manage recipes using markdown files.
- View recipes in a user-friendly interface.
- Customizable build process using `build.sh`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Fepozopo/culinary-keepsakes.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd culinary-keepsakes
    ```

## Usage

1. Build the project using the updated `build.sh` script:
    ```bash
    ./build.sh
    ```
    The script will generate the necessary files and start a local server.
2. Place any new images in the `new_images` folder before running the build script. This ensures they are processed and included correctly.
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`.
